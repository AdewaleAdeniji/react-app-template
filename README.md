A React-Redux and Tailwind CSS / Styled Components boilerplate for any future project

These technologies were used:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindcss.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com)
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

### Folder Structure

This boilerplate has been set up with React, Tailwind, Redux, and React-Router

#### React

The React components are subdivided between two folders, ``` ./components```and ```./containers```. Generally, containers refer to "smart" components and components refers to "dumb" components. Dumb here meaning stateless or re-usable. 

I generally use the containers folder to have my main pages './HomePageContainer', './AboutPageContainer', etc. and keep all the re-usable components that compose these containers in the components folder. 

When the project grows, the folder structure is usually re-organized for all the related components to be grouped together in new folders.

#### Styled Components

Kept Styled Components here in case there are specific re-usable components that we are going to need throughout the application. Might remove it later if necessary and if the bundle size of the application is too large. 

#### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a great library for quick iteration and fast development. It's a CSS fraework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center, etc. that allows us to make styling a faster process. 

#### React-Router

The routes are all stored in the ```Routes.js``` file of the ```./routing``` folder. There, you'll find two special components

1. ```UnauthenticatedRoute``` --> Routes that don't require the user to be logged in to be displayed
2. ```AuthenticatedRoute``` --> Routes that require the user to be logged in to be displayed

The **Authentication state** is stored in the **authentication reducer** in the Redux store. It is passed down as a prop to the ```App.js``` component. Any call to the reducer with the respective action creator will trigger the **isAuthenticated** state to change and will show or hide components accordingly.

#### Action Creators

Actions creator functions are all stored in the ```./actionCreators``` file

#### Reducers

Finally, the reducers are all in the ```./reducers``` file, which for now contains one reducer, the authentication reudcer.

## Why â›©

Setting the boilerplate of a project usually takes away from the momentum of a good idea. Lost momentum might lead to a loss in productivity. More importantly, lost momentum is simply lost energy, lost positivity, it's just annoying. I don't need this in my life. This should allow me to jump start any project in the future.
